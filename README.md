####IMPORTANT INFO####

If you are a thinkful student still using nitrous (like me), please note the maximum file size that can be uploaded is 2MB and the "chord.wav" file that they provide to use as an example is 8.5MB.

Also, the file_post() function needs to be modified to create and commit a song to the database as well, otherwise you won't be able to play the song.

You will know that your song player is working when you see the luke.png camel spinning as your song is playing...
